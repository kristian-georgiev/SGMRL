# SG-MRL 

## Code for Provably Convergent Policy Gradient Methods for Model-Agnostic Meta-Reinforcement Learning

This codebase is based off of the [ProMP repository](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/ProMP).

To run the setup from the numerical experiments section of our paper, please use `sgmrl_experiments/vpg_run.py`. Our modified implementation is located in `maml_zoo/meta_algos/vpg_sgmrl.py`.
